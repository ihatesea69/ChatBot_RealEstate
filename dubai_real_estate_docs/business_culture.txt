# Business Culture and Negotiation in Dubai Real Estate

## Cultural Nuances in Dubai Business

### Business Etiquette
When meeting with property developers or agents in Dubai, greetings are important. A handshake is the standard greeting, though some may use the traditional Arabic greeting of touching noses. Business cards should be presented with the right hand or both hands as a sign of respect. Always accept refreshments (typically Arabic coffee and dates) when offered, as refusing can be seen as impolite.

### Communication Style
Arabs generally prefer face-to-face meetings over email communication. Personal relationships are highly valued in business dealings. Expect some small talk before discussion of business matters. Direct criticism is avoided; "maybe" or "we'll see" often means "no." Patience is essential as decisions may take longer than in Western business cultures.

### Religious Considerations
Business meetings are not scheduled during prayer times. The workweek runs Sunday through Thursday, with Friday and Saturday being the weekend. During Ramadan, business hours are reduced, and you should avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public during daylight hours.

## Negotiation Tactics in Dubai Real Estate

### Price Flexibility
In Dubai's real estate market, prices are often negotiable. Sellers typically build a margin of 10-15% into asking prices, expecting buyers to negotiate. Cash buyers can often secure discounts of 5-10% from advertised prices. For off-plan properties, developers may be more flexible on payment plans than on headline prices.

### Bargaining Strategies
Expressing interest in multiple properties simultaneously can improve your negotiating position. Local agents recommend starting with an offer 15-20% below asking price for resale properties. Being prepared to walk away is often an effective tactic, as sellers may follow up with a better offer if they're genuinely motivated.

### Timeline Expectations
Real estate transactions in Dubai typically move faster than in many Western countries, with 30-45 days being standard from agreement to completion. However, initial negotiations may include several rounds of offers and counteroffers. Showing urgency can sometimes weaken your position, so patience is valuable during negotiations.

## Working with Real Estate Agents

### Agent Commission
Real estate agents in Dubai typically charge 2% commission, split between buyer's and seller's agents if both are involved. This is negotiable, especially for high-value properties. Some agents offer reduced commissions in exchange for exclusivity agreements.

### Agency Relationships
Unlike some markets, dual agency (representing both buyer and seller) is common in Dubai. Exclusive agency agreements are not standard practice, and buyers often work with multiple agents simultaneously. However, establishing a relationship with a single, trusted agent can provide access to off-market properties and developer incentives.

### Agent Qualifications
All real estate agents must be registered with the Dubai Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) and hold a broker card. Asking to see an agent's RERA card is standard practice and should not cause offense. Experienced agents will have broker numbers that start with lower digits, indicating earlier registration.
